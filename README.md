# dive-xml
Read data from Suunto D4i dive computer, place into sqlite db for analysis

Eventually I'd like to use libdivecomputer to manage the aqcuisition of dive logs
  - Suunto's DM5 software has corrupted many of my dive logs on the dive computer
  - It works but isn't great
  - I don't want to replace subsurface or mac dive
  
My goal is to eventually use this for data analysis and potentially incorporating into a GIS software such as QGIS to create ocean maps with details about depth, temps, animal counts, etc.

Eventually also work with photos, audio recordings, etc. to help create some sort of time-related data for conservation
